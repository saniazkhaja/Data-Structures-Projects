DISCLAIMER: This live coding prompt is purposely ambiguous.  We arenâ€™t going to tell you exactly how to cout, exactly how to handle edge cases, etc.  There is no autograder and auto grading would defeat the purpose of the exercise.  Instead, you should talk through all of your thoughts and state any assumptions as you are solving the problem.  

You got this.  :D  

PROMPT:

**********************
About - This file contains twenty-four months of data taken from steamspy.com, listing the number of games released from Jan. 2018 until Dec. 2019.  The first three lines of the file are a header.  Each remaining text item is an integer representing the number of games released in that month (starting in Jan. 2018) followed by a 3 letter abbreviation of the month, and underscore, and the year.  As you work through the problem state any assumptions.

File reading - read the data in. Store header in a string variable and rest of the data stack of structs.  

Process/Calculations - Store all the months where the number of games released from one month to the next increased into a vector of strings.  Remember your data is stored in a stack so when doing the calculation, you will be doing so backwards in time.  Print out all months you found to the screen (in order of increasing time).  
Do these calculations after file reading and storing all your data in the original container.  

Creative component (if time permits) - create one cin and one cout for this problem.  Make sure your code uses the cin.

Good luck!
